      "Answer: A\n",
      "Rationale: The increasing use of biomolecular identification techniques, such as mass spectrometry, offers a more precise and comprehensive approach to aerobiological monitoring compared to traditional pollen analysis. These techniques can identify allergenic pollen components, including proteins and glycoproteins, with greater accuracy and sensitivity, allowing for a better understanding of the allergenic potential of pollen and the development of more targeted allergy management strategies. This new perspective provides a more detailed and informative picture of the pollen composition in the air, leading to improved monitoring and prediction of pollen-related health risks.\n",

      "Rationale: The biomechanical and wound healing characteristics of corneas after excimer laser keratorefractive surgery differ between advanced surface ablation (ASA) and sub-Bowman's keratomileusis (SBK). ASA, which includes techniques like photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) and laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK), involves creating a flap on the cornea, which can affect the biomechanical properties and wound healing process.

      "B. No\n",
      "********************************************************************************\n",
      "Answer: A\n",
      "Rationale: Radiotherapy to the primary rectal cancer can potentially affect the prognosis after pelvic exenteration for recurrent rectal cancer. The extent of the primary tumor, the presence of lymph node involvement, and the response to neoadjuvant therapy (if any) can all influence the outcome of pelvic exenteration. Radiotherapy may have altered the tumor microenvironment, potentially affecting the efficacy of the surgical resection and the subsequent response to adjuvant therapy. Therefore, radiotherapy history should be considered when planning and evaluating the outcome of pelvic exenteration for recurrent rectal cancer.\n",

      "Rationale: While eye-tracking abnormalities can occur in schizophrenia, they are not the primary cause of motion perception deficits. Motion perception deficits are more likely to be a direct result of the neurological changes associated with schizophrenia, such as altered processing in the visual cortex or disruptions in the neural pathways involved in motion processing. Eye-tracking abnormalities may be a secondary consequence of these neurological changes, but they are not the root cause of the perceptual deficits.\n",

      "Rationale: Transgastric endoscopic splenectomy (TES) is a surgical technique that allows for the removal of the spleen through the stomach. This approach is typically used when the spleen is severely enlarged or when there are contraindications to laparoscopic splenectomy, such as significant adhesions or a history of prior abdominal surgery. The procedure involves creating a small incision in the stomach wall, and then using endoscopic instruments to access and remove the spleen. While TES is a viable option in certain circumstances, it is not a standard or widely performed procedure.\n",

It is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate and aggressive treatment, including surgical debridement, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and supportive care. While the initial infection can be devastating, with prompt and appropriate management, the chances of survival and limb preservation are significantly improved. Therefore, Fournier's gangrene remains dangerous, but it is not necessarily fatal if treated promptly.\n",

      "Rationale: While kidney transplantation can be life-saving, the suitability of a donor kidney for a recipient depends on various factors, including age, health status, and the overall condition of the kidneys. In the case of elderly donors, the kidneys may have a reduced functional capacity due to age-related changes. Implanting such kidneys in young recipients could lead to a shorter lifespan for the recipient, as the donor kidney may not be able to adequately compensate for the recipient's underlying health issues. Therefore, it is generally not appropriate to implant kidneys from elderly donors in young recipients.\n",

      "Rationale: While carotid artery stenosis assessment is important for patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG), it is not always necessary. The decision to perform a carotid ultrasound or other imaging study depends on the patient's clinical presentation, risk factors, and the surgeon's judgment. If the patient has a history of stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), or other neurological symptoms suggestive of carotid artery disease, then assessment is more likely to be performed. However, in patients with no such symptoms and a low risk of carotid disease, the benefits of carotid imaging may not outweigh the risks and costs. The surgeon will consider\n",

      "Rationale: Androgens, such as testosterone, play a role in sexual desire in women, although the exact mechanisms and the extent of their influence are complex and not fully understood. Studies have shown that higher levels of androgens are generally associated with increased sexual desire and arousal in women. However, the relationship is not always straightforward, and other factors, such as estrogen levels, psychological factors, and overall health, also contribute to sexual desire. Therefore, while androgens can contribute to sexual desire in women, they are not the sole determinant.\n",

      "Answer Choices:\n",
      "A. Abdominal rectopexy\n",
      "B. Delerom's procedure\n",
      "C. Anterior resection\n",
      "D. Goodsall's procedure\n",
      "********************************************************************************\n",
      "Answer: A\n",
      "Rationale: Abdominal rectopexy is the preferred surgical approach for complete rectal prolapse in young males. It involves mobilizing the rectum and securing it to the sacrum, providing a permanent solution and preserving bowel function. Delerom's procedure is a less common option, and anterior resection and Goodsall's procedure are typically reserved for cases with significant rectal disease or when rectopexy is not feasible.\n",

      "The drug that inhibits uterine contractility and cause pulmonary edema is:\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer Choices:\n",
      "A. Ritodrine\n",
      "B. Nifedipine\n",
      "C. Indomethacin\n",
      "D. Atosiban\n",
      "********************************************************************************\n",
      "Answer: A\n",
      "Rationale: Ritodrine is a beta-adrenergic agonist that causes uterine contractions and can lead to pulmonary edema, especially in women with underlying cardiac conditions. Nifedipine is a calcium channel blocker used to relax uterine muscles and prevent preterm labor. Indomethacin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that inhibits prostaglandin synthesis, which can reduce uterine contractility. Atosiban is an oxytocin receptor antagonist that inhibits uterine contractions.\n",

      "D. Togaviridae\n",
      "********************************************************************************\n",
      "Answer: B\n",
      "Rationale: Influenzae virus is a member of the Orthomyxoviridae family. This family is characterized by its segmented RNA genome and its ability to undergo antigenic shift, which is a major reason why influenza viruses are difficult to control.\n",

      "Question:\n",
      "Several weeks after surgical dissection of her left axilla for the removal of lymph nodes for staging and treatment of her breast cancer, a 32-year-old woman was told by her general physician that she had \"winging\" of her left scapula when she pushed against resistance during her physical examination. She told the physician that she had also experienced difficulty lately in raising her right arm above her head when she was combing her hair. In a subsequent consult visit with her surgeon, she was told that a nerve was accidentally injured during the diagnostic surgical procedure and that this produced her scapular abnormality and inability to raise her arm normally. What was the origin of this nerve?\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer Choices:\n",
      "A. The upper trunk of her brachial plexus\n",
      "B. The posterior division of the middle trunk\n",
      "C. Roots of the brachial plexus\n",
      "D. The posterior cord of the brachial plexus\n",
      "********************************************************************************\n",
      "Answer: B\n",
      "Rationale: The patient's symptoms of scapular winging and difficulty raising her arm above her head are classic signs of injury to the long thoracic nerve. The long thoracic nerve originates from the posterior division of the second intercostal nerve, which is a branch of the second thoracic nerve, which is a branch of the posterior cord of the brachial plexus. The long thoracic nerve innervates the serratus anterior muscle, which is responsible for protracting the scapula and rotating it upward, allowing the arm to be raised above the head. Injury to this nerve results in the serratus anterior muscle becoming paralyzed, leading to\n",

      "********************************************************************************\n",
      "Answer: B\n",
      "Rationale: Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) is a serious complication of solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. It is characterized by the uncontrolled proliferation of lymphocytes, most commonly B cells, in the setting of immunosuppression. The underlying cause is Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, which is often reactivated in immunocompromised patients.\n",

      "D. Regular insulin\n",
      "********************************************************************************\n",
      "Answer: D\n",
      "Rationale: Regular insulin is the only insulin that can be administered intravenously. The other types of insulin are designed for subcutaneous injection. Protamine zinc insulin is a long-acting insulin that is administered subcutaneously. Ultra lente insulin is a long-acting insulin that is administered subcutaneously. Semi lente insulin is a short-acting insulin that is administered subcutaneously.\n",

      "D. Vitamin D deficiency\n",
      "********************************************************************************\n",
      "Answer: A\n",
      "Rationale: Megaloblastic anemia is characterized by large, immature red blood cells. Folate and vitamin B12 are essential for DNA synthesis, which is crucial for red blood cell production. Folate deficiency leads to impaired DNA synthesis, resulting in megaloblastic anemia. Glossitis (inflammation of the tongue) and pharyngeal ulcers are also common in folate deficiency. Impaired immunity is a consequence of the overall nutritional deficiency. Thiamine deficiency causes beriberi or Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, niacin deficiency causes pellagra (characterized by the \"4 D's\": dermatitis, diarrhea, dementia, and\n",

      "D. 5a-transferase inhibitors\n",
      "********************************************************************************\n",
      "Answer: B\n",
      "Rationale: Tamsulosin is an alpha-1a adrenergic receptor blocker. Alpha-1a receptors are found in the prostate and bladder neck, and blocking these receptors helps to relax the smooth muscle in these areas, improving urine flow.\n",

      "Answer Choices:\n",
      "A. Rapid urease test\n",
      "B. Urea breath test\n",
      "C. Endoscopy and biopsy\n",
      "D. Serum anti H.Pylori titre\n",
      "********************************************************************************\n",
      "Answer: B\n",
      "Rationale: The urea breath test (UBT) is the most appropriate method for detecting residual H. pylori infection after treatment. It involves the patient ingesting urea, which is then broken down by H. pylori urease into carbon dioxide. The presence of carbon dioxide in the exhaled breath indicates active H. pylori infection. The rapid urease test is a rapid test done on a biopsy sample, endoscopy and biopsy is invasive and not the best method for detecting residual H.Pylori infection, and serum anti H.Pylori titre is not the best method for detecting residual H.Pylori infection\n",
